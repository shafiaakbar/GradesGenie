 GRADEGENIE!

Keeping track of grades, credit hours, and GPA trends shouldn’t be a hassle. That’s why I built a project GradeGenie—an AI-tool that lets students query their transcripts in plain English. No more scrolling through PDFs or logging into portals—just ask:



🔹 "What’s my GPA for Spring 2023?"

🔹 "How many credit hours have I completed?"

🔹 "Which courses do I need to retake?"



HOW GRADEGENIE WORKS?

⚡ Extracts transcript data (PDF/HTML parsing)

🔍 Stores & searches with FAISS

🧠 Uses AI embeddings (Hugging Face)

💬 Generates responses with Mistral AI + LangChain
